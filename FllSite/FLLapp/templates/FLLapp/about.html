<h1>About us!</h1>
<p>
We are a team of middle school students who are interested in helping to save and help animals who are struggling because of animal testing. We have created this website to help regular people find a new pet, help scientist help their animals, and help rehab centers/shelters find a home for their animals. We are doing this because we learned that innocent animals are being tested on and we want to find alternatives. FLL has taught us stuff
